          <h2>about me</h2>
          I'm a junior web developer and an ex-librarian who loves organization
          and pretty things!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have my Master's degree in Library and Information Studies and am
          currently taking a full stack flex coding bootcamp and will complete
          it in April 2024. I'm highly resourceful and a quick learner and I
          love rainy days and iced coffee. I can't wait to create new things and
          learn more. Watch this space for real content coming soon!
