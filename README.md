  This is a personal website designed to showcase my full stack web development skills. It is built using React and Styled Components and contains a portfolio showing my MERN web development skills as well as my design and teamwork skills. There is a Contact Me section for a user to submit a message using a form and a Resume section that allows the user to view or download my resume as a PDF.
